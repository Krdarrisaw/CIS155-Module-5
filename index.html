        <h1>Welcome to Kim's Travel Adventures</h1>

        <p>
            Traveling has always been something I want to do more of. I like learning about different places, 
            trying new food, and seeing what everyday life looks like in other parts of the world. 
            This site highlights a few destinations that I really want to visit in the future.
        </p>

        <h2><span class="highlight">Top Places I Want to Visit</span></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Tokyo, Japan – for the culture, food, and city energy.</li>
            <li>Paris, France – mainly for the art and landmarks.</li>
            <li>Bali, Indonesia – because the scenery looks peaceful and relaxing.</li>
        </ul>
